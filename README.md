# Debander_OpenFX
Debanding filter as an OpenFX plugin. 

This is intended to be a subtle filter that cleans up banding in high-quality 8-bit video.

This is NOT meant to clean up gross problems like blocking in JPEG or MPEG images, though it can be used on such images.

As of 2016-06-12,
 * With Natron 64-bit, works fine.
 * With DaVinci Resolve, fails to have any effect.
